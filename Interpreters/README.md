# Interpreters

Sometimes it is useful to write an interpreter for a language. Here I have a few interpreters for different things. Mostly these exist because I think interpreters are neat and fun, but some of them may have actually been useful at some point.

## Lispy

Lispy is a Lisp-like interpreter written in Python. It is heavily borrowed from Peter Norvig's blog post ["(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))"](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

## Schemekell

Schemekell comes from the Wikibook ["Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours"](https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).
